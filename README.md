[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/flexiant/concerto/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/flexiant/concerto/latest) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/flexiant/concerto?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/flexiant/concerto)

Flexiant Concerto Command Line Interface allows you to interact with Concerto features, and build your own scripts calling Concerto's API.

If you already know Concerto CLI, and only want to obtain the latest version, download Concerto from [this link](https://drone.io/github.com/flexiant/concerto/latest)

If you want to build the CLI using the source code, please, take into account that the master branch is used for development, it is unstable and might be broken. Download stable tagged versions to use Flexiant Concerto CLI.
